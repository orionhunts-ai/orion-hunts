# Orion Agents

Orion Agents are designed explicitly for acting semi-autonomously within the bounds of their instructions. They are purpose built for the entire recon phase of the kill chain in their hunt for Adversarial AI.


**As of April 1st the Agents have not yet been specified. To contribute:
- Say hi! orion@synavate.tech
- 
 choose a language and build as you feel comfortable:
 - Go, Rust or Python 
   - At present prototyping is in Python ideally, as well as ML
   - Go Backend (TBC)
   - Rust for high performing components as the ecosystem improves (TBC)

No single language has been chosen but will move with the community.
